Backend environment (`apps/backend/.env`):
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://ipl_user:ipl_pass@localhost:5432/ipl_auction?schema=public"
REDIS_HOST="localhost"
REDIS_PORT=6379
NODE_ENV="development"
PORT=3001
CORS_ORIGIN="http://localhost:5173"
SESSION_SECRET="change-this-in-production"
```

Frontend environment (`apps/frontend/.env`):
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

### 4. Start infrastructure (Postgres + Redis)

```bash
docker-compose up -d postgres redis
```

Wait for services to be healthy (~10 seconds)

### 5. Setup database

```bash
# Generate Prisma Client
pnpm db:generate

# Run migrations
pnpm db:migrate

# Seed 574 players from auction.csv
pnpm db:seed
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Inserted 574 players
📊 Database Statistics:
   Total Players: 574

   Uncapped: ~234
   Retained: 47
```

### 6. Start development servers

```bash
# Start both frontend and backend
pnpm dev
```

This runs:
- Backend: http://localhost:3001
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173

**OR use the automated quick-start script:**

```bash
./scripts/quick-start.sh
```

## 🐳 Docker Development

Run entire stack with Docker Compose:

```bash
# Build images
docker-compose build

# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

Access:
- Frontend: http://localhost:80
- Backend API: http://localhost:80/api
