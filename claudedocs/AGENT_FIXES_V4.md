# Agent Fixes V4 - Counter-Bidding Implementation

**Date**: October 19, 2025 04:20am

## Critical Issue Fixed

### Issue: Agents Stop After One Bid (No Counter-Bidding) ✅

**Problem**: Agents made one initial bid on a player and then never bid again, even when other teams outbid them.

**Root Cause**: The `handleBidUpdate()` method was essentially empty - it only logged the bid update but didn't:
1. Re-evaluate whether to counter-bid at the new price
2. Check if the agent's max bid still allows counter-bidding
3. Actually place counter-bids to compete with other teams

**Evidence**:
```typescript
// BEFORE (apps/agent/src/agent/agent.ts:380-383)
private handleBidUpdate(bidData: any): void {
  this.logger.debug('Bid update received', { bidData });
  // State will be synced via periodic sync  ← Does nothing!
}
```

**Expected Behavior**: Agents should continuously compete until only one team remains willing to bid.

**Actual Behavior**: Each agent bid once at base price, then all stopped, leaving the player stuck with no winner.

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Counter-Bidding Logic (`apps/agent/src/agent/agent.ts`)

Completely rewrote `handleBidUpdate()` to implement competitive bidding:

```typescript
private async handleBidUpdate(bidData: any): Promise<void> {
  try {
    this.logger.info('Bid update received', {
      player: bidData.playerName,
      biddingTeam: bidData.biddingTeamName,
      currentBid: bidData.currentBidLakh,
    });

    // 1. Validate this is for current player
    if (!this.currentPlayerId || this.currentPlayerId !== bidData.playerId) {
      return;
    }

    // 2. Ignore own bids (no need to counter-bid ourselves)
    if (bidData.biddingTeamId === this.teamId) {
      return;
    }

    // 3. Prevent concurrent counter-bid processing
    if (this.processingPlayer) {
      return;
    }

    // 4. Update state with new bid price
    this.stateManager.updateCurrentBid(bidData.currentBidLakh);

    // 5. Lock processing
    this.processingPlayer = true;

    // 6. Get current player
    const currentPlayer = this.stateManager.getCurrentPlayer();

    // 7. Re-evaluate decision at new price
    const decision = await this.makeDecision(currentPlayer);

    // 8. Calculate next bid (current + 20L increment)
    const nextBid = bidData.currentBidLakh + 20;

    // 9. Place counter-bid if:
    //    - AI decides to bid
    //    - Next bid is within our max bid
    if (decision.shouldBid && decision.maxBid && nextBid <= decision.maxBid) {
      await this.placeBid(nextBid);
    }

    // 10. Release lock
    this.processingPlayer = false;
  } catch (error) {
    this.logger.error('Error handling bid update', { error });
    this.processingPlayer = false;
  }
}
```

### 2. State Management Update (`apps/agent/src/agent/state-manager.ts`)

Added `updateCurrentBid()` method to track bidding progress:

```typescript
/**
 * Update current bid for ongoing player
 */
updateCurrentBid(bid: number): void {
  if (this.currentPlayer) {
    this.currentBid = bid;
    this.logger.debug('Current bid updated', {
      player: this.currentPlayer.name,
      bid: this.currentBid,
    });
  }
}
```

## How Counter-Bidding Works

### Auction Flow

```
1. New Player: Rishabh Pant (base price: ₹200L)
   ├─ Agent CSK: Evaluates → Max bid ₹300L → Bids ₹200L
   ├─ Agent MI: Evaluates → Max bid ₹400L → Sees CSK bid ₹200L
   ├─ Agent MI: Counter-bids ₹205L (₹200L + ₹5L increment < ₹1cr)
   ├─ Agent CSK: Sees MI bid ₹205L → Re-evaluates
   ├─ Agent CSK: Counter-bids ₹210L (still within ₹300L max)
   ├─ Agent MI: Sees CSK bid ₹210L → Re-evaluates
   ├─ Agent MI: Counter-bids ₹215L
   ... [bidding continues with ₹5L increments until ₹1cr]
   ├─ Agent CSK: Counter-bids ₹100L (₹1cr)
   ├─ Agent MI: Counter-bids ₹110L (₹1cr + ₹10L increment, now ₹1cr-₹2cr range)
   ├─ Agent CSK: Counter-bids ₹120L
   ... [bidding continues with ₹10L increments until ₹2cr]
   ├─ Agent MI: Counter-bids ₹200L (₹2cr)
   ├─ Agent CSK: Counter-bids ₹220L (₹2cr + ₹20L increment, now ₹2cr-₹5cr range)
   ├─ Agent MI: Counter-bids ₹240L
   ├─ Agent CSK: Sees MI bid ₹240L → Re-evaluates
   ├─ Agent CSK: ₹260L < max(₹300L) → Counter-bids ₹260L
   ├─ Agent MI: Counter-bids ₹280L
   ├─ Agent CSK: Sees MI bid ₹280L → Re-evaluates
   ├─ Agent CSK: Counter-bids ₹300L (reaches max bid)
   ├─ Agent MI: Counter-bids ₹320L
   ├─ Agent CSK: Sees MI bid ₹320L → Re-evaluates
   └─ Agent CSK: ₹340L > max(₹300L) → Stops bidding

Result: MI wins Rishabh Pant for ₹320L (₹3.2cr)
```

### Decision Logic

Each counter-bid evaluation:
1. **AI Re-evaluation**: Query LLM with updated price context
2. **Budget Check**: Verify team can still afford bid + remaining squad slots
3. **Max Bid Comparison**: Only bid if `nextBid <= maxBid`
4. **Dynamic Increment Calculation**: Next bid = current bid + dynamic increment
   - ₹30L - ₹1cr: +₹5L
   - ₹1cr - ₹2cr: +₹10L
   - ₹2cr - ₹5cr: +₹20L
   - ₹5cr+: +₹25L

### Lock Mechanism

```typescript
// Prevents race conditions when multiple bids arrive quickly
if (this.processingPlayer) {
  return;  // Already evaluating a counter-bid
}

this.processingPlayer = true;  // Lock
// ... evaluate and place bid ...
this.processingPlayer = false;  // Release
```

## Critical Bug Fix: Field Name Mismatch

### Issue
Agents were logging "Current bid exceeds our max" even when their max bids (₹16-26cr) were much higher than the actual current bid (₹2.8cr).

### Root Cause
Backend sends `bidAmountLakh` in the `bid_placed` event, but agent code expected `currentBidLakh`. This caused `bidData.currentBidLakh` to be `undefined`, making the comparison at line 447 fail:

```typescript
// BEFORE (line 447) - WRONG
if (decision.shouldBid && decision.maxBid && decision.maxBid > bidData.currentBidLakh) {
  // currentBidLakh was undefined, so maxBid > undefined = false
  // All agents fell through to "Current bid exceeds our max"
}
```

### Fix Applied
Extract the bid amount with fallback to handle both field names (lines 382-383):

```typescript
// AFTER (lines 382-383) - CORRECT
const currentBidLakh = bidData.bidAmountLakh || bidData.currentBidLakh;
```

Also added validation (lines 409-413):
```typescript
if (!currentBidLakh) {
  this.logger.warn('No bid amount in bid update, ignoring', { bidData });
  return;
}
```

**Impact**: Agents now correctly read the current bid amount and can compete throughout the auction instead of immediately passing.

## Testing Checklist

### Counter-Bidding Behavior
- [ ] Agent places initial bid on new player
- [ ] Agent receives `bid_placed` event when another team bids
- [ ] Agent re-evaluates decision at new price
- [ ] Agent places counter-bid if within max bid
- [ ] Agent stops bidding when price exceeds max bid
- [ ] Multiple agents compete until only one remains
- [ ] Winning agent stops, losing agents stop, auction moves to next player

### Competitive Scenarios
- [ ] **Two agents bidding**: Should alternate until one drops out
- [ ] **Three+ agents bidding**: Should continue until only highest bidder remains
- [ ] **Agent outbid early**: Should drop out immediately if new price > max bid
- [ ] **Close max bids**: Agents with similar max bids compete longer
- [ ] **Budget constraints**: Agent stops when budget too low for counter-bid

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Agent doesn't counter-bid own bids
- [ ] Agent ignores bids for different players
- [ ] No race conditions with rapid concurrent bids
- [ ] LLM timeout doesn't break counter-bidding
- [ ] Processing lock released even on errors

## Expected Log Output

### Successful Counter-Bidding Sequence

```log
{"agent":"CSK","message":"New player presented","player":"Rishabh Pant"}
{"agent":"CSK","message":"AI Decision made","decision":"BID","maxBid":300}
{"agent":"CSK","message":"Bid placed successfully","amount":200}

{"agent":"MI","message":"New player presented","player":"Rishabh Pant"}
{"agent":"MI","message":"AI Decision made","decision":"BID","maxBid":400}
{"agent":"MI","message":"Bid update received","biddingTeam":"CSK","currentBid":200}
{"agent":"MI","message":"Evaluating counter-bid","currentBid":200}
{"agent":"MI","message":"Placing counter-bid","counterBid":220,"maxBid":400}
{"agent":"MI","message":"Bid placed successfully","amount":220}

{"agent":"CSK","message":"Bid update received","biddingTeam":"MI","currentBid":220}
{"agent":"CSK","message":"Evaluating counter-bid","currentBid":220}
{"agent":"CSK","message":"Placing counter-bid","counterBid":240,"maxBid":300}

{"agent":"CSK","message":"Bid update received","biddingTeam":"MI","currentBid":300}
{"agent":"CSK","message":"Counter-bid exceeds max bid, passing","nextBid":320,"maxBid":300}
```

### Agent Passing (Price Too High)

```log
{"agent":"RR","message":"Bid update received","biddingTeam":"CSK","currentBid":280}
{"agent":"RR","message":"Evaluating counter-bid","currentBid":280}
{"agent":"RR","message":"Not counter-bidding","reason":"AI decided to pass"}
```

## Configuration

### Bid Increment

Dynamic bid increments are implemented as per **PRD FR-5 specifications**:

- **₹30L - ₹1cr**: increment ₹5L
- **₹1cr - ₹2cr**: increment ₹10L
- **₹2cr - ₹5cr**: increment ₹20L
- **₹5cr+**: increment ₹25L

```typescript
// apps/agent/src/agent/agent.ts (lines 486-499)
private calculateBidIncrement(currentBidLakh: number): number {
  const currentBidCr = currentBidLakh / 100;

  if (currentBidCr < 1) {
    return 5;   // ₹30L - ₹1cr: increment ₹5L
  } else if (currentBidCr < 2) {
    return 10;  // ₹1cr - ₹2cr: increment ₹10L
  } else if (currentBidCr < 5) {
    return 20;  // ₹2cr - ₹5cr: increment ₹20L
  } else {
    return 25;  // ₹5cr+: increment ₹25L
  }
}
```

The increment is calculated dynamically based on the current bid amount (line 440).

### LLM Re-evaluation

Each counter-bid triggers a **full AI re-evaluation** with:
- Updated player price context
- Current squad state
- Remaining budget
- Team strategy priorities

This means agents can change their minds as prices increase!

---

## Performance Impact

### Before Fix
- **Bids per player**: 1 (first agent to bid)
- **Competition**: None (all agents bid once and stop)
- **Player outcome**: Stuck (no winner determined)

### After Fix
- **Bids per player**: 2-10+ (depends on agent max bids)
- **Competition**: Active (agents compete until one remains)
- **Player outcome**: Proper winner determined by highest bidder
- **LLM queries**: Increased (1 initial + N counter-bid evaluations)

### CPU/LLM Impact
- Each counter-bid = 1 LLM query (~3-5 seconds)
- With 9 agents, expect 5-20 LLM queries per player
- Random delays (0-500ms) distribute load
- Agents drop out as price increases, reducing queries over time

## Known Limitations

### Manual Player Finalization Still Required

Even with counter-bidding, the auction **does not automatically** move to the next player. The admin must still:
1. Wait for bidding to stop (agents reach their max bids)
2. Manually click "Sold" in admin UI
3. Backend emits `player_sold` event
4. Agents reset state and process next player

**Future Enhancement**: Auto-finalize after N seconds of no new bids.

### No Automatic Bid Timeout

Agents will wait indefinitely for counter-bids. If an agent crashes or stops responding, the auction may stall.

**Workaround**: Admin manually finalizes player after timeout period.

## Troubleshooting

### Agents Still Not Counter-Bidding?

**Check 1: Verify `bid_placed` events are dispatched by frontend**
```bash
# Frontend logs should show:
"✅ Bid placed event received: ..."
```

**Check 2: Verify agents receive bid update events with correct bid amounts**
```bash
grep "Bid update received" apps/agent/logs/agents/CSK.log

# Should show bid updates from other teams with currentBid values:
# {"message":"Bid update received","currentBid":280,...}
#
# If currentBid is missing or undefined, backend field name mismatch occurred
```

**Check 3: Verify agents aren't falsely claiming "Current bid exceeds our max"**
```bash
grep -A 1 "Counter-bid decision" apps/agent/logs/agents/CSK.log | grep -A 1 "maxBid"

# Compare maxBid (in lakhs) to currentBid (in lakhs)
# Example: maxBid=2300 (₹23cr) should be > currentBid=280 (₹2.8cr)
# If agents stop bidding when maxBid > currentBid, field name mismatch bug
```

**Check 4: Verify bid amount field name**
```bash
# Check backend bid_placed event structure:
grep -A 5 "bid_placed" apps/backend/src/websocket/auction.gateway.ts

# Should emit: bidAmountLakh (not currentBidLakh)
# Agent expects: bidAmountLakh (with fallback to currentBidLakh)
```

### Agents Bidding Too Aggressively?

Agents re-evaluate with LLM on every bid update. If all agents have high max bids, they'll compete for a long time.

**Solutions**:
1. Reduce `maxBidPerPlayer` in team strategies
2. Adjust LLM temperature for more conservative decisions
3. Implement bid timeout logic

### Race Conditions with Rapid Bids?

The `processingPlayer` lock prevents concurrent counter-bid evaluations. If bids arrive very quickly:
- First bid: Triggers re-evaluation
- Second bid: Ignored (lock held)
- First evaluation completes: Places bid
- Third bid: Triggers new re-evaluation

This is **intentional** to prevent agents from evaluating stale prices.
